# Hi, I'm Dominik 👋

I am a **Lead Backend Developer** with a passion for building scalable, robust, and efficient server-side solutions. I specialize in crafting clean architecture and delivering high-performance systems that power modern applications 🚀.

**🔭 Currently, I'm leading backend development as a Lead Backend Developer at @NFCtron.**

## 🛠️ My Tech Stack

When I code, I focus on building powerful backend systems using:

- **TypeScript** - For type-safe, maintainable code
- **Node.js** - For scalable server-side applications
- **PostgreSQL** - For robust data persistence and complex queries
- **DevOps** - For infrastructure, CI/CD, and deployment automation
