## 🎯 About Me

I'm a **Lead Backend Developer** with a passion for crafting clean architecture and delivering high-performance systems. I specialize in building scalable backend infrastructure that handles millions of transactions, powers real-time event management, and ensures secure payment processing.

**🔭 Currently:** Leading backend development at [@NFCtron](https://github.com/NFCtron), building the infrastructure that powers cashless payments and event management across Europe.

**💡 Fun Fact:** I love solving complex problems with elegant solutions and believe that great backend code should be both performant and maintainable.
